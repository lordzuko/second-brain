<li><strong>Geometric Meaning of Positive Definite Matrix:</strong>
Eg; Hessian in optimization, covariance in gaussian etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The geometric meaning of a positive definite matrix is closely related to its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. A matrix A is positive definite if it satisfies the following conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>A is symmetric: A = A^T, meaning it is equal to its transpose.</li>
<li>All eigenvalues of A are positive: λ &gt; 0 for all eigenvalues λ of A.</li>
</ol>
<p>The positive definite matrix has significant geometric implications:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Positive-Definiteness and Quadratic Forms: A positive definite matrix defines a positive quadratic form. This means that when a vector is multiplied by the matrix, the result is always positive, except when the vector is the zero vector. Geometrically, this corresponds to an ellipsoid centered at the origin that is entirely contained within the positive orthant of the space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defining an Inner Product: A positive definite matrix can be used to define an inner product, also known as a dot product, in a vector space. The inner product measures the angle between vectors and provides a notion of distance or similarity. The positive definiteness ensures that the inner product satisfies the necessary properties, such as being positive, symmetric, and satisfying the triangle inequality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Convexity: Positive definiteness plays a crucial role in convex optimization and convex sets. In particular, if the Hessian matrix of a function is positive definite, the function is convex. Convexity has important implications in optimization, as it guarantees the existence and uniqueness of global minima and efficient optimization algorithms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Positive-Definite Matrices as Covariance Matrices: Positive definite matrices are commonly used as covariance matrices in multivariate statistics and probability theory. Covariance matrices represent the variance and covariance relationships between different variables. The positive definiteness of the covariance matrix ensures that the variables are positively correlated but not perfectly linearly dependent, enabling reliable statistical analysis.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The importance of positive definite matrices lies in their properties and applications across various fields, including optimization, geometry, statistics, and machine learning. They provide essential mathematical tools for solving optimization problems, defining distances and angles, characterizing convex sets, and modeling relationships between variables. The positive definiteness ensures the reliability and meaningfulness of these mathematical operations and concepts.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>change in coordinates, using an eigenvalue decomposition</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Eigenvector and eigenvalue
<em>Given a square matrix A, an eigenvector is a non-zero vector v such that when A is applied to v, the resulting vector is parallel to v. In other words, v only changes by a scalar factor when multiplied by A. This scalar factor is called the eigenvalue corresponding to that eigenvector.</em></p>
<p>Given a square matrix (A), the eigenvalue decomposition expresses (A) as the product of three matrices:</p>
<p>$A = VDV^{-1}$</p>
<p>where (V) is a matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of (A), (D) is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of (A), and $V^{-1}$ is the inverse of $V$.</p>
<p>To perform a change in coordinates using the eigenvalue decomposition, the steps are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Eigendecomposition: Find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the matrix A.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coordinate Transformation: Define a new coordinate system by using the eigenvectors as the basis vectors. These eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis for the space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transformation Matrix: Construct a matrix (T) whose columns are the eigenvectors of (A). This matrix (T) represents the transformation from the original coordinate system to the new coordinate system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diagonal Matrix: Form a diagonal matrix (\Lambda) using the eigenvalues of (A). Each eigenvalue appears on the diagonal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change of Coordinate Formula: The change of coordinate formula relates the original coordinates (x) in the original coordinate system to the new coordinates (y) in the transformed coordinate system:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>$y = T^{-1}x$</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>$x = Ty$</p>
<p>Here, $T^{-1}$ is the inverse of the transformation matrix (T).</p>
<p>The eigenvalue decomposition allows for a change of coordinates that simplifies the representation of mathematical problems, revealing underlying structure and facilitating analysis in the transformed coordinate system.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basis vectors</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Basis vectors are fundamental vectors that form a basis for a vector space. They serve as building blocks for representing any vector within that space. A set of basis vectors is chosen to span the entire space and provide a unique representation for each vector.</p>
<p>In more detail:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Basis for a Vector Space:</p>
<ul>
<li>A vector space is a collection of vectors that satisfies certain properties, such as closure under addition and scalar multiplication.</li>
<li>A basis for a vector space is a set of vectors that spans the entire space (i.e., any vector in the space can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors) and is linearly independent (i.e., no vector in the set can be expressed as a linear combination of the other vectors in the set).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Representation of Vectors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any vector within a vector space can be represented as a linear combination of the basis vectors.</li>
<li>For example, in a two-dimensional space, a vector v can be represented as v = a * v1 + b * v2, where v1 and v2 are the basis vectors, and a and b are scalar coefficients.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standard Basis:</p>
<ul>
<li>The standard basis refers to a set of basis vectors in which each vector has a single element equal to 1 and all other elements equal to 0.</li>
<li>In a two-dimensional space, the standard basis consists of two vectors: [1, 0] and [0, 1].</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coordinate Representation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The coefficients of the linear combination used to represent a vector with respect to the basis vectors are called the coordinates or components of the vector.</li>
<li>For example, in a two-dimensional space with the standard basis, the vector [3, 2] can be represented as 3 * [1, 0] + 2 * [0, 1], and its coordinates are (3, 2).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Basis vectors play a crucial role in linear algebra and various applications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coordinate systems: Basis vectors define the coordinate axes in a given vector space, enabling the representation and measurement of quantities along those axes.</li>
<li>Vector operations: Basis vectors are used to decompose vectors into their components, perform vector addition and scalar multiplication, and compute dot products and cross products.</li>
<li>Linear transformations: Basis vectors can be transformed by linear transformations, allowing the understanding and analysis of how these transformations affect vectors in the space.</li>
</ul>
<p>Choosing an appropriate set of basis vectors is essential for effectively representing vectors and solving problems in a given vector space. The choice of basis vectors can vary depending on the context and the problem at hand, and different bases can offer different advantages or insights into the underlying structure of the vectors and operations within the space.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>orthonormal basis</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>An orthonormal basis is a set of vectors in a vector space that is both orthogonal and normalized. Each vector in the basis is perpendicular (orthogonal) to every other vector in the set, and each vector has a length of 1 (normalized). Orthonormal bases have several important properties and applications in linear algebra and signal processing.</p>
<p>More specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Orthogonality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Orthogonal vectors are perpendicular to each other, meaning their dot product is zero.</li>
<li>In an orthonormal basis, all vectors are pairwise orthogonal. This property simplifies calculations and makes it easier to express vectors as linear combinations of the basis vectors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Normalization:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each vector in an orthonormal basis has a length (norm) of 1.</li>
<li>Normalized vectors provide a consistent scale, making it easier to reason about their relative magnitudes and simplify computations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matrix Representation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Orthonormal bases play a significant role in linear algebra, especially when representing matrices as collections of column vectors.</li>
<li>A matrix with columns representing an orthonormal basis is called an orthogonal matrix. Its inverse is equal to its transpose, and its rows are also orthonormal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coordinate Systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Orthonormal bases define coordinate systems in vector spaces, where each coordinate axis corresponds to a basis vector.</li>
<li>By expressing vectors in terms of their coordinates with respect to an orthonormal basis, computations and transformations become more intuitive and efficient.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Signal Processing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Orthonormal bases are crucial in areas such as Fourier analysis and wavelet analysis.</li>
<li>Fourier basis functions, such as sine and cosine waves, form an orthonormal basis for representing signals in the frequency domain.</li>
<li>Wavelet functions also provide an orthonormal basis for analyzing signals at different scales and resolutions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Orthonormal bases have numerous advantages, including simplified calculations, easier interpretation of vectors, efficient signal representation, and robustness in numerical computations. They serve as fundamental tools in various areas of mathematics, including linear algebra, signal processing, and data analysis.</p>
<p>Examples of orthonormal bases include the standard basis in Euclidean space (where each basis vector corresponds to a unit vector along the coordinate axes) and the Fourier basis functions (where each basis vector represents a specific frequency component).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>what are conjugate directions and explain its relationship to gradient descent with line search</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Conjugate directions are a concept used in optimization algorithms, particularly in the context of solving unconstrained optimization problems. In the context of gradient descent with line search, conjugate directions play a crucial role in improving the efficiency of the optimization process.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an explanation of conjugate directions and their relationship to gradient descent with line search:</p>
<p>Sure! Here&rsquo;s the explanation of conjugate directions and their relationship to gradient descent with line search in LaTeX-supported markdown:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Conjugate Directions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given a problem of minimizing a function $f(x)$, a set of vectors ${d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n}$ is said to be a set of conjugate directions if they satisfy the property that for any $(i \neq j)$, the direction vectors are orthogonal with respect to a positive-definite matrix $A$. In other words, $d_i^T A d_j = 0$ for $i \neq j$.</li>
<li>The conjugate directions allow us to search the solution space in mutually orthogonal directions, ensuring that we don&rsquo;t revisit the same directions during the optimization process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gradient Descent with Line Search:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function. It iteratively updates the current solution by taking steps in the direction of the negative gradient of the function.</li>
<li>In gradient descent with line search, the step size (learning rate) is determined by performing a line search along the descent direction to find the optimal step size that minimizes the function along that direction.</li>
<li>The descent direction in each iteration is typically chosen as the negative gradient of the function at the current solution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relationship to Conjugate Directions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conjugate directions are particularly useful when the function being minimized is not quadratic. In such cases, using the standard gradient descent direction may result in slow convergence or oscillations.</li>
<li>By incorporating conjugate directions into the optimization process, we can effectively search the solution space in more efficient and independent directions, potentially leading to faster convergence.</li>
<li>Conjugate directions help avoid unnecessary backtracking or oscillations by ensuring that the search proceeds along orthogonal directions that are not redundant with previous search directions.</li>
<li>Conjugate gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that combines the benefits of conjugate directions with gradient descent, allowing for efficient optimization in non-quadratic problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, conjugate directions provide a way to optimize functions more efficiently by ensuring independent and orthogonal search directions during the optimization process. Incorporating conjugate directions into gradient descent with line search can help accelerate convergence and avoid unnecessary oscillations, particularly in non-quadratic optimization problems.</p>

<li>A probabilistic model <em>prescribes</em> the probability measure of a random experiment!</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many ways to prescribe a probabilistic measure:</p>
<ul>
<li>We may specify the measure of events in the event space, one at a time. This is very tedious and sometimes impossible (eg. all the subsets of natural numbers)</li>
<li>We may instead specify a probability mass or density function (PMF or PDF) for outcomes of a random variable 1Using probability distribution - changing parameters (PDF)</li>
<li>We may instead specify the cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of an RV, the CDF in turn identifies a PDF, the RV and its PDF identify a probabilistic measure</li>
